# Trello Scrum Points
A UserScript that shows Scrum points in Trello

## How to install?
* Method 1: Use [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome) and install the script by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Minishlink/TrelloScrumPoints/master/trello-scrum-points.user.js)
* Method 2: [download the script](https://github.com/Minishlink/TrelloScrumPoints/raw/master/trello-scrum-points.user.js) and install it manually in the Extensions tab of your browser

## Why?
I was using the popular extension [Scrum for Trello](http://scrumfortrello.com/), but the page becomes unbearably slow when boards grow, even on a high-end computer.
The `Trello Scrum Points` UserScript keeps the most useful feature of this extension, which is counting the total of Scrum points for each Trello list.

## How to optimize Trello even more?
* Disable cover images
* Use a script that hides/shows Trello lists (like [Trellists](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trellists-trello-lists-ma/dgnlcodfeenegnifnpcabcclldoceeml))
* Archive your Done columns, or move them to another board
* Have more tips? PRs are welcome! :)
